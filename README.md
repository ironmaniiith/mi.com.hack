# Xiaomi pair 2 win game bot  [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com//ironmaniiith/Github-profile-name-writer/star)

Recently Xiaomi has launched a game by the name [**Pair 2 Win**](http://www.mi.com/in/events/2ndanniversary/playgame/) where some people are at the top (Obviously through some **smart** ways :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:  ), but why not try that way yourself :smile:

Just copy paste the `script.js` in the console (by hitting F12) after starting the game, and it will do the rest.

Hope it will help you get a __free__ Mi Mobile and many other cool __free__ stuffs :smile: 

Happy Hacking.

Also there's one more easier way to hack this game, but why don't you try it yourself :wink:
